# Personal Website

A personal website is a great way to sell yourself while job hunting. Your website should include information about who you are, what you do, and link to places you are on the internet (GitHub, LinkedIn, etc.). It can also serve as an online resume with a portfolio of your work. Extending that further, it can also be a nice way to talk about things that you are learning or projects that you working on in a blog form as well. 

There are 4 different types of personal websites that you might create:

- Static Landing Page
- Static Site with several pages (think Home, Projects, Contact, etc.)
- Static Blog (Blog without comments)
- Full Blog Site (with comments)

## Requirements

Create a personal website/hub for your job hunt. 

Should have at a minimum: 

- contact info
- link to LinkedIn
- links to github repos. 

Consider adding images for your pinned projects, assuming a visitor may not click through the repo.

> If you choose to include a blog, make sure to continue updating it on a regular basis so the site doesn't look forgotten or out of date!
