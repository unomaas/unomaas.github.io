# My Portfolio 

Hello, thank you for your interest in my work and viewing my portfolio!  And especially more so for looking at the code for my portfolio!   


## Description:


This is the ReadMe for my personal portfolio page, built and fine-tuned by yours truly!  I've personally spent *far* too much time tweaking little things and adding easter eggs to this page, so I appreciate you being here to make that time worthwhile. <3 


## Usage:

Browse to your hearts content!  I've done my best to make my portfolio as smooth as seamless as possible.  In the top right, there is a hamburger navigation menu with smooth-scrolling.  There are also down-arrows on the page for ease-of-navigation.  Lastly, viewing "What I've Created" will load my previous projects, which can be demo'd via a gif by clicking on each thumbnail.

I'm proud to state this page is fully responsive and can be viewed on PC or mobile!


### Accessibility:

I strive to make my apps accessible to all!  This particular project is fully detailed with descriptions for text-readers.  

### Built With:

JavaScript/HTML/CSS, jQuery, and Sass. 

### Acknowledgement:

I'd like to give thanks to Dane Smith, and everyone in Prime Academy's Genocchi cohort, for teaching me everything at Prime Digital Academy!  I wouldn't be here today without them.

### Support:
If you have suggestions, comments, or issues, please contact me at rdmjobs@live.com. Thanks for reviewing my project! Stay wonderful. <3
